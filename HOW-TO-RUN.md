# How to Run FC Shining Stars Web Application

This document provides instructions on how to run the FC Shining Stars web application.

## Option 1: Open Directly in Browser (Simplest)

For basic viewing of the website without server functionality:

1. Double-click the `open-website.bat` file
2. This will open the website directly in your default browser

**Note:** Some features that require server functionality may not work with this method.

## Option 2: Run with Simple HTTP Server

For a more complete experience with server functionality:

1. Double-click the `start-simple-server.bat` file
2. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000
3. To stop the server, close the command prompt window

## Option 3: Run with Node.js Serve (If Available)

If the serve package is working correctly:

1. Double-click one of the following batch files:
   - `run-web-server.bat`
   - `run-serve.bat`
   - `run-web-app.bat`
2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the command prompt
3. To stop the server, close the command prompt window

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure Node.js is installed correctly
2. Try running the commands directly in a command prompt with administrator privileges
3. Check if there are any error messages in the command prompt window
